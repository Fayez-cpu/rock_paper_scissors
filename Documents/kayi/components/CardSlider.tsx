The mixed grill was delicious. The chicken was cooked just right with a BBQ flavour that didn't dry the meat.
I will be returning to KAYI once a week during my stay in Derby as it is only a 5 minute walk from the Mickleover court hotel.
The service was also very friendly and accommodating. Thank you for such a good experience.`,
